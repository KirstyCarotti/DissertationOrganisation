A database for the system needs to be configured in order for it to run. The researcher used MSSQL to manage this database.
To set up the database the Server name needs to be set to the local machine. In appsettings.json change "DESKTOP-7UDB2B7\\MSSQLSERVER01" To the local machine. 

All other API calls go through the system localhost and therefore they should not need changing. 

Some dependencies may need to be installed using package manager.
